This is the code for the CIKN 2021 Paper: [Label-informed Graph Structure Learning for Node Classification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459637.3482129).

## Usage

The `main` branch is the model described in the paper.
The `combine` branch, which simply combines `IDGL` and `CPGNN`, seems to work better on Cora and Citeseer than `main`
